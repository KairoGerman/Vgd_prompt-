Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: the game is a fps game and it added a weapon of destrucion and this is a Based off a bunch of you gain weapons you win rounds.

Setup Instructions: Xbox controller and then 90fps

Reflection: Creating this game was a fun and challenging experience. I learned how to add multiple enemies and weapons, making the gameplay more exciting. One challenge I faced was balancing the different weapons so that each one felt useful. I solved this by adjusting damage and fire rates. I’m proud of how I added multiple rooms, which makes the game feel bigger and more interesting. In the future, I’d like to improve enemy AI and add more weapon types for even more variety.
