Playing Torque Drift is really fun because you get to drift cars around corners and try to stay in control while going super sideways. You can feel the tires sliding and the car shaking as you try to hit the perfect angle. It’s cool how you can customize your car and make it look however you want, then take it online and race against other players. Sometimes it’s hard to get the timing right, but when you pull off a smooth drift, it feels awesome.
