Assignment 5: Scene Development and Code Mod

Changes I Made:
- Increased the player’s movement speed from 5 to 8.
- Switched control input from GetAxis to GetAxisRaw for better control feel.
- Added background music that loops using an Audio Source.
- Created a win trigger that activates when the player touches a flag.

 Challenges I Faced:
- Music wasn’t playing at first — fixed by adding an Audio Source and checking "Play On Awake".
- Player wouldn’t trigger win — solved by adding "Player" tag and enabling "Is Trigger".
 
How I Solved Them:
- Used Unity’s Console to debug.
- Searched Unity forums and used built-in documentation.
- Asked classmates for help with `OnTriggerEnter2D`.

 What I'm Most Proud Of:
- The win condition — it makes my game feel complete.
- The smoother controls after editing the movement script.
- Adding music made a big difference in the vibe of the game.
